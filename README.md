**Goal:**

Realistically, the aim of this project is to create a database system for easy disposable use with a ridiculously simple access method. Eventually this will simply be a module for node.js however in its current state i am simply building functionality. The database access scheme will be via browser request and for a single user only. Therefore this will be ideal for blogs, personal databases and other kinds of data you may need for your web app/site.
